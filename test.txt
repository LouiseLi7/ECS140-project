Stage 1: Read in the File
Tasks:
1. Define a CStream struct that is able to read the input file character by character.
• Unlike C++, Rust does not have a convenient way of reading a file character by character
using FileInputStream. For simplicity, you may read the whole file at once and store it in a
string or a vector of strings. Then you may read the stored string or vector of strings character
by character.
• But keep in mind that this is not how modern scanner works because the input program may
be too large to be stored as a second copy.
• Do NOT modify the input program in any way. If it has an extra newline that makes it ugly,
that leave it be.
2. Read the input file from command line.
3. Print the stored file to the screen.
Note:
• Stage 1 is worth 10 points.
